# Greenhouse-Gas-Emission-Analysis

This project investigates the correlation between Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and global temperature fluctuations. Using publicly available datasets on CO₂ emissions (EDGAR) and global land temperature (Berkeley Earth), the study analyzes how human activities influence climate change.

The analysis includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Trend analysis of CO₂ emissions by country and sector

Correlation between emissions and temperature anomalies

Forecasting future CO₂ emissions using regression models

Visualizations including bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps
